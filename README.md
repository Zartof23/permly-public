## 📱 About Permly

Permly is an Android notification manager that lets you create custom profiles to selectively mute notifications from specific apps. Unlike "Do Not Disturb" modes that block everything, Permly gives you granular control over which apps can notify you in different situations.

### Your Focus Guardian

Think of Permly as your personal attention guardian - protecting your focus by letting through only what matters while quietly filtering out distractions.

**Selective, Not Silent** - Work mode? Silence social apps. Family time? Mute everything except calls from loved ones. You're in control.

Your privacy is our priority:

- **Never reads notification content** - We only see which app sent a notification, not what it says
- **All data stays on your device** - No cloud storage, no servers, no transmission
- **No tracking or analytics** - We don't collect any personal data
- **No ads** - Clean, distraction-free experience
